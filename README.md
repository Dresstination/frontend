Your one stop destination for fashion suggestions.

This app uses Gemini API to provide the ability to generate different fashion suggestions based on your need/occasion. All you need to do is write a prompt of your requirement, and it will give you AI generated images of the appropriate outfits for the occasion, description of how you should wear it best, and links to similar outfits on popular shopping websites.
